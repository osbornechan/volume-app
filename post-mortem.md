## Approach and Process
### What in my process and approach to this project would I do differently next time?

Focus on one aspect of the project rather than trying to do a bit of everything.

### What in my process and approach to this project went well that I would repeat next time?

As much as I disliked working with Rails, the error messages are extremely helpful and explicit, which helped tremendously with debugging.

## Code and Code Design
### What in my code and program design in the project would I do differently next time?

Code is not very DRY, despite using React and being able to encapsulate reusable components, so that can be improved.

### What in my code and program design in the project went well? Is there anything I would do the same next time?

Got better understanding of making GET/POST/PUT requests with React and the flow of API calls.

## SEI Unit 4 Post Mortem
### What habits did I use during SEI that helped me, that I will take on to my future coding projects?

Just keep fingers on keyboard everyday, and keep trying and breaking code. Best way to learn is through error messages.

### What habits did I have during SEI I can improve on that I will try to change on future projects?

I kept largely to tools taught within the course, whereas there are many more alternative resources outside, which I should have taken time to learn.

### How is the overall level of the course? (instruction, course materials, etc.)

The course in general was a directional sign, pointing in the right general direction to look at, and focused more on imparting functional coding. But it will take a lot of personal reading and learning to know more in depth.
